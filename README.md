# GeoGuessr guess locker
### Lock in your guess when playing GeoGuessr.

Press "L" or middle mouse button to lock in your guess. Once locked in you won't be able to change your guess unless you refresh the screen.

There is one big issue with this script .... it doesn't load 100% of the time. Keep refreshing the screen until you see a confirmation message, a [hard reload](https://bacreative.com.au/how-to-hard-refresh-browser-and-clear-cache-using-windows-or-linux/) might make it work. This script needs to load early in the page load process, and sometimes (despite it's best efforts) it doesn't quite make it. Reloading the page a few times should get it to work.

[Click here to install](https://github.com/echandler/GeoGuessr-guess-locker/raw/main/GeoGuessrGuessLocker.user.js). If that didn't work, copy the contents of the user.js file into a new tampermonkey script.
